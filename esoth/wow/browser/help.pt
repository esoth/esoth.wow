  <h1>How Do I Use This?</h1>
                        
  <p>
    This tool is intended to help you keep track of what gear you still need to obtain for your character on a per boss basis. Periodic updates from the WoW Web API (armory)
    can help automate what gear you have acquired, but it is otherwise up to you to use the action icons to mark gear as "equipped", "best in slot (BIS)",
    "acquired" or "downgrade"
  </p>
  
  <hr/><br/>
  <ul class="gearlisting">
    <li><img tal:attributes="src string:${portal_url}/++resource++esoth.wow/equipped.png" /> <b>Equipped</b> - This is the gear you are currently using. One per slot.</li>
    <li><img tal:attributes="src string:${portal_url}/++resource++esoth.wow/acquired.png" /> <b>Acquired</b> - You have acquired this gear but may not be using it until you
      get another tier piece or something. You can have multiple per slot.</li>
    <li><img tal:attributes="src string:${portal_url}/++resource++esoth.wow/bis.png" /> <b>BiS</b> - These items (can be multiple per slot) are your goal for that slot.</li>
    <li><img tal:attributes="src string:${portal_url}/++resource++esoth.wow/downgrade.png" /> <b>Downgrade</b> - This item is worse than what you already have equipped and/or acquired.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr/><br/>
  
  <p>
    Go through each slot via the drop down and use these actions. The rightmost table shows you what you still have left to acquire. This is meant to be the
    primary purpose of the tool - which bosses do I need in for, for the purpose of loot?
